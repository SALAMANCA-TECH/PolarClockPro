Project Overview
This project aims to create a beautiful and functional polar clock that is not only a timepiece but also a useful daily tool. The long-term vision is to develop this web application into a native mobile app for both iOS and Android platforms.

Features
Polar Clock Display: Visual representation of months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

Customization:

Multiple color schemes (Default, Neon, Pastel, Colorblind-friendly).

Toggle for gradient effects.

Show/hide separator lines for time and date.

Tools:

Timer: Set a countdown with an optional repeat function.

Alarm: Set a daily alarm with sound.

Stopwatch: Standard start/stop/lap functionality with an optional interval sound.

Settings:

Switch between 12-hour and 24-hour time formats.

Change the label display mode (Standard, Percentage, Remainder).

Project Structure
The repository is organized to support scalability and the future transition to a mobile application.

Getting Started
To run this project locally, simply open the index.html file in a modern web browser.

Future Development
The roadmap for Polar Clock Pro includes:

Code Refactoring: Transitioning the current JavaScript into a more modular, component-based architecture (e.g., using a framework like React or Vue.js). This is a crucial step for mobile app development.

Mobile App Development: Using a cross-platform framework like React Native or Flutter to build the iOS and Android applications from the refactored codebase.

Additional Features:

More sound options for alarms and timers.

Saving multiple alarm presets.

Exporting stopwatch lap times.

Weather integration.

Themes that change based on the time of day.
