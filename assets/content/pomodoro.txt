The Pomodoro Technique
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

How It Works
The technique involves the following steps:

Choose a task to be accomplished.

Set the Pomodoro timer to 25 minutes.

Work on the task until the timer rings.

Take a short break (usually 5 minutes).

After four Pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes).

Using the Pomodoro Timer in Polar Clock Pro
Polar Clock Pro has a built-in Pomodoro Technique mode to help you stay focused.

Open the settings panel.

Under "Structured Work Timers," select "Pomodoro Technique."

The innermost data arc on the clock will now visually represent the 25-minute work interval.

When the work interval is over, the clock will signal it's time for your 5-minute break.
