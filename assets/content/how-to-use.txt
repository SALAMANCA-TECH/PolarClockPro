How to Use Polar Clock Pro
The Clock Face
The main interface of Polar Clock Pro displays time through a series of concentric data arcs. From the inside out, these arcs represent:

Timer/Alarm Arc: An optional, innermost ring for timers.

Month of the Year

Day of the Month

Hour of the Day

Minute of the Hour

Second of the Minute

Week of the Year: An optional, outermost ring.

As time passes, each arc will fill up, and upon completion, it will perform a smooth "reverse fill" animation before starting its next cycle.

Settings Panel
All customization and productivity tools are located in the accordion-style settings panel.

Structured Work Timers:

Pomodoro Technique: A pre-configured timer with 25-minute work intervals and 5-minute breaks.

Custom Timer: Set a countdown timer for any task.

Toggleable Arcs:

You can show or hide the "Week of the Year" arc to simplify the display.

Separator Style:

Standard: Clean, simple lines between the arcs.

Ruler: More detailed, tick-marked lines for a technical look.
